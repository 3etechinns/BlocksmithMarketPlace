# Description
A platform for investment in tangible assets where anyone can
invest, providing existing asset owners with liquidity for the renovation or construction
of properties for subsequent sale.
For each investment opportunity, the investors can buy with ether a certain amount of
tokens from the asset owner. He should later be able to sell them to other parties with
ether whenever he chooses to capitalise gains or reduce losses.
